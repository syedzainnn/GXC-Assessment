# DXC-Assessment
Set of accomplished tasks for the assessment procedure

DXC-Assessment contains set of tasks that each target a different category of problem-solution. Each task demonstration is contained within the Scene folder.

1. Camera Control:

Task/Problem => Create a Camera view controller that has multiple view modes. 

- A free-view mode that allows the user to orbit and zoom around either of the cubes.
- A viewpoint mode that locks the camera position in place ( No Orbit), where the user can still look around and zoom.
- A switch button that switches the focus anchored. This camera transition is smooth and handled in code.


2. GUI Control:

Task/Problem: Create a scrollable/auto layout empty UI group panel with 3 control buttons.

Button 1: Adds 10 random UI items to the group, each one is defined by a random string index.
Button 2: Reorders UI items by their index in an ascending order.
Button 3: Inserts a new UI item with a random index at the proper position.
